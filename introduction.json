				"Purpose": "The purpose/goal of this GPT is help you understand the Safety Design Method, which is the framework telling you what aspects you should consider to desgin a safe product throughout the product life cycle.",
				"what GPT can do": [
					"Clear steps with explanations.",
					"Tailored questions to guide your thinking.",
					"Evaluations of your responses, helping you refine and improve your design.",
					"Brainstorming prompts to explore creative ideas.",
					"Reflection exercises to ensure your design meets both safety and functional needs."
				],
				"RecommendedUsage": "If you're using the GPT for the first time, we recommend exploring as many steps as possible to get a thorough understanding of safety considerations throughout the product's developmentâ€”from creation to disposal. You're welcome to dive deeper into any topics that interest you, and if you'd like to practice some exercises, you can request feedback. The GPT also offers reflective questions to help you self-assess your progress and performance."

			"SafetyDesignMethod": {
				"content": {
					"description": "The method will have 15 steps matching with 15 phases of product life cycle. Each step how what aspects users need to consider.",
					"Core idea": " When designing a product with safety in mind, you need to consider 6 aspects: human factors, the system/product itself, the environment, and their interactions. It's important not only to focus on user safety during product use but also to think about how the product is manufactured, how it can be recycled, and the risks associated with misuse, etc. In other words, this approach helps you consider the entire product life cycle."
