          "Example": "In a car braking system, subsystems such as the pedal, hydraulic lines, and calipers must interact without error. The interface between the pedal and the hydraulic system must ensure the brake functions promptly when pressed."

          "Example": "In aircraft navigation, subsystems like communication and navigation must interface efficiently, ensuring that communication delays do not affect flight data transmission."

          "Aspect": "Plan for Future Wear and Replacement",
          "WhatItMeans": "The design must account for the wear and tear of components over time, ensuring that they can be easily replaced or upgraded. The system should also be adaptable to future technological advances or changes in user needs.",
          "Example": "In a wind turbine, components like rotor blades or gearboxes must be designed for easy replacement, reducing downtime during maintenance. The design should also allow for integration of future efficiency improvements."
